In order to use Google Drive, you will need a Google account. Google accounts are free, and signing up for one is fairly simple. In order to create a Google account, you'll need to enter some information, including your name, birth date, and location. Creating a Google account will automatically create a Gmail email address and a Google+ profile.

## Creating a Google account

* Go to https://www.google.com. Locate and select the Sign in button in the top-right corner of the page.
* Click Create an account.
* The sign-up form will appear. Follow the directions and enter the required information.
* Next enter your phone number. Google will send a verification code to your phone that you will use to complete the sign up process.
* Enter the verification code sent to your phone and click Verify.
* The personal information page will appear. Follow the directions and enter your information, including your birth date and gender.
* Review Google's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, then click I agree.
* Your account will be created.

## Accessing Google Drive

Once you've set up your Google account, you can access Google Drive by going to http://drive.google.com in your web browser.

You can also navigate to Google Drive from any Google page (such as Gmail or Google search) by selecting the grid icon near the top-right corner, then clicking Drive.
